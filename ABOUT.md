Alloy Instances is a simple viewer for sharing [Alloy](http://alloytools.org/) models and instances hosted on [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com). For example, if your Gist URL is:

<code>
    <a href="https://gist.github.com/atdyer/8d019e744c083a08bb5ac9c2ef181c9c">
        https://gist.github.com/atdyer/8d019e744c083a08bb5ac9c2ef181c9c
    </a>
</code>

Replace the "gist.github.com" with "alloy-js.herokuapp.com" in the URL to view it:

<code>
    <a href="https://alloy-js.herokuapp.com/atdyer/8d019e744c083a08bb5ac9c2ef181c9c">
        https://alloy-js.herokuapp.com/atdyer/8d019e744c083a08bb5ac9c2ef181c9c
    </a>
</code>

The visualization is created automatically using an XML file exported from Alloy. To export an XML file from Alloy, click `File` &#x2192; `Export To` &#x2192; `XML...`, or press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> when viewing an instance.

Customize the appearance of your Alloy Instance page by adding a `.alloy` YAML configuration. The following options are supported:
* `license` - a supported [SPDX short identifier](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical)
* `height` - the SVG height in pixels; defaults to 500
* `border` - yes if the SVG should have a border; defaults to no
* `show-model` - no if the model code should be hidden; defaults to yes
* `show-style` - no if the instance style should be hidden; defaults to yes
* `instance` - the XML file in the gist to visualize; defaults to `instance.xml`

## Styling

Customize the instance visualization by adding an `instance.yaml` style. A tutorial on styling visualization and description of all options can be found [here](/style). By default, the following style is used:

```yaml
groups:
  edges:
    index: 0
    shape: line
    data: tuples
  nodes:
    index: 1
    shape: rectangle
    data: atoms
```

## User Pages

All of your Alloy Instances can be viewed on your user page. For example, if your Gist URL is:

<code><a href='https://gist.github.com/atdyer/'>https://gist.github.com/atdyer</a></code>

Replace the "gist.github.com" with "alloy-js.herokuapp.com" in the URL to view it:

<code><a href='https://alloy-js.herokuapp.com/atdyer'>https://alloy-js.herokuapp.com/atdyer</a></code>

Note that the gist description is used as the title of the Alloy Instance in both the user page and the Alloy Instance page.
